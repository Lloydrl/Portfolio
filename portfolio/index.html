            <!-- experience -->
            <p>I began my education pursuing a degree in Business Administration at Longwood University, and quickly decided to concentrate in Information Technology and Cyber Security. Following college, I was promoted to Junior Manager and then Manager where I was currently employed. I learned fast that it was not what I enjoyed. I remembered how much I enjoyed my programming class in college and, after some planning, I decided to take the PDX Coding Guild Bootcamp to pursue a career in web programming.</p>
            <!-- goal -->
            <p>My goal is to pursue a career in web programming as I have quickly grown to love the field. My passion for always learning new things and challenging myself drives me to do my best work in the programming feild specifically. I am excited to begin a new career and to contribute my positive and hard-working personility while doing what I am passionate about. </p>
